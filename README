=====SCALA TRAINING LAB INSTRUCTIONS=====
=========================================

The Scala training labs are divided into two modules:
* labs
* solutions

You do your work in 'labs' and can check the 'solutions' for ideas on how to implement a solution.
All labs are test-driven, so you workflow is something like this: 

1. Uncomment the test in the lab you want to work on (in the 'labs' module)
2. Run 'mvn test' and see it fail
3. Fix the test so it compiles and passes 

All labs have instructions on what you should do in the ScalaDoc in the code. 

Enjoy, Jonas.
